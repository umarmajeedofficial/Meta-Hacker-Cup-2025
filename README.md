# Meta Hacker Cup 2025 - Solutions Repository

Welcome to my **Meta Hacker Cup 2025** solutions repository! This repo contains the solutions to all the problems I tackled during the **Meta Hacker Cup 2025** Practice Round. The aim of this repository is to provide clean, efficient solutions to each problem, along with detailed explanations of the approach I took to solve them.

## Overview

In the **Meta Hacker Cup 2025** practice round, participants were tasked with solving a variety of programming challenges. This repository contains my solutions, written in Python (or other relevant languages), along with detailed descriptions of the problem-solving approach I employed. It was a great learning experience that sharpened my skills in algorithm design, time complexity analysis, and debugging.

I placed **#45 globally** out of **9,000+ participants** and **2nd in Pakistan**, which was an incredible milestone, and I’m sharing my solutions for others who are preparing for future rounds or want to see how these problems can be approached.

## Solutions

Each problem in the competition has its own solution file inside the **`solutions/`** directory. Below is a breakdown of the structure:

1. **Problem 1**: [Link to solution](solutions/problem_1.py)
2. **Problem 2**: [Link to solution](solutions/problem_2.py)
3. **Problem 3**: [Link to solution](solutions/problem_3.py)
4. **Problem 4**: [Link to solution](solutions/problem_4.py)
5. **Problem 5**: [Link to solution](solutions/problem_5.py)

Each solution includes:
- Problem description
- Approach to solving the problem
- Code implementation
- Time complexity analysis (where applicable)

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout the Meta Hacker Cup 2025 practice round, I learned several key lessons:

- **Efficient Data Handling**: I gained a deeper understanding of handling large data sets and optimizing for speed.
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Solving some problems required carefully analyzing and optimizing algorithms for better performance, especially for time-sensitive challenges.
- **Persistence**: Sometimes, problems took longer to solve, but persistence and iteration were key to success.

These lessons will be valuable for future competitions and for my overall growth as a developer.
