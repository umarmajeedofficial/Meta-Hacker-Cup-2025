# Meta Hacker Cup 2025 - Solutions Repository

Welcome to my **Meta Hacker Cup 2025** solutions repository! This repo contains the solutions to all the problems I tackled during each round of the competition. I’ve organized the repository into separate folders for each round, with each folder containing the 5 problems from that round. The goal is to provide clean, efficient solutions to each problem, along with detailed explanations of the approach I took to solve them.

## Overview

In **Meta Hacker Cup 2025**, participants were tasked with solving a variety of programming challenges across different rounds. This repository contains my solutions to these problems, written in **Python** (or other relevant languages), and includes detailed descriptions of the problem-solving approach I employed. The practice round and the subsequent rounds sharpened my skills in algorithm design, time complexity analysis, and debugging.

I placed **#45 globally** out of **9,000+ participants** and **2nd in Pakistan**, which was an incredible milestone. I’m sharing these solutions to help others who are preparing for future rounds or who want to understand how these problems can be approached.

## Solutions

The solutions are organized by round, with each round containing 5 problems. Below is a breakdown of the folder structure:

* **Practice Round**:

  * **Problem 1**: [Link to solution](practice-round/problem_1.py)
  * **Problem 2**: [Link to solution](practice-round/problem_2.py)
  * **Problem 3**: [Link to solution](practice-round/problem_3.py)
  * **Problem 4**: [Link to solution](practice-round/problem_4.py)
  * **Problem 5**: [Link to solution](practice-round/problem_5.py)

* **Round 1**:

  * **Problem 1**: [Link to solution](round-1/problem_1.py)
  * **Problem 2**: [Link to solution](round-1/problem_2.py)
  * **Problem 3**: [Link to solution](round-1/problem_3.py)
  * **Problem 4**: [Link to solution](round-1/problem_4.py)
  * **Problem 5**: [Link to solution](round-1/problem_5.py)

* **Round 2**:

  * **Problem 1**: [Link to solution](round-2/problem_1.py)
  * **Problem 2**: [Link to solution](round-2/problem_2.py)
  * **Problem 3**: [Link to solution](round-2/problem_3.py)
  * **Problem 4**: [Link to solution](round-2/problem_4.py)
  * **Problem 5**: [Link to solution](round-2/problem_5.py)

* **Round 3**:

  * **Problem 1**: [Link to solution](round-3/problem_1.py)
  * **Problem 2**: [Link to solution](round-3/problem_2.py)
  * **Problem 3**: [Link to solution](round-3/problem_3.py)
  * **Problem 4**: [Link to solution](round-3/problem_4.py)
  * **Problem 5**: [Link to solution](round-3/problem_5.py)

* **Final Round**:

  * **Problem 1**: [Link to solution](final-round/problem_1.py)
  * **Problem 2**: [Link to solution](final-round/problem_2.py)
  * **Problem 3**: [Link to solution](final-round/problem_3.py)
  * **Problem 4**: [Link to solution](final-round/problem_4.py)
  * **Problem 5**: [Link to solution](final-round/problem_5.py)

Each solution includes:

* Problem description
* Approach to solving the problem
* Code implementation
* Time complexity analysis (where applicable)

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout the Meta Hacker Cup 2025, I learned several key lessons:

* **Efficient Data Handling**: Gained a deeper understanding of handling large data sets and optimizing for speed.
* **Algorithm Optimization**: Some problems required optimizing algorithms for better performance, especially under time constraints.
* **Persistence**: Some problems took longer to solve, but persistence and iteration were key to success.

These lessons will be valuable for future competitions and for my growth as a developer.
